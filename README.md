# Aviation_Dashboard_Excel
This repository contains an interactive Excel-based dashboard that visualizes civil aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The dashboard provides insights into accident trends over time, by location, by phase of flight, by purpose of flight, damage severity, and key performance indicators (KPIs).


# Features

Accidents by Year: Line chart tracking accidents over years to highlight historical trends.

Accidents by Purpose of Flight: Bar chart categorizing accidents (e.g., private, commercial, instructional).

Phase of Flight Breakdown: Pie or column chart illustrating the flight phases with the highest occurrences.

Aircraft Damage Summary: Distribution of damage levels (e.g., substantial, destroyed).

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Metrics for total accidents, fatalities, serious injuries, and average yearly change.
